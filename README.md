Phonegap_skeleton_android
=========================

These are all base files and styles needed to create a very native-looking Android application with Phonegap Build.

 * Slide-out menu with the three-lines like the modern google apps.
 * Colors follow the design guidelines.
 * Google's "roboto" fonts.
 * Functioning "back" button (rare in Phonegap apps).
 * Components of a "card" UI.
 * Hardware accelerated CSS 3 animations (So NO lag)
 * Fully customizable.
 * Commented.
 * Seriously, this looks and acts native.

To understand some of the code I have in here, you will need to know:
 * Font awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
 * Transit JS: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
 * Jquery
 * JQuery Mobile
 * Phonegap API


.

You should be able to figure out the code by looking at it; I commented the entire thing and named my clsses and IDs accordingly.

If you have any problem figuring something out, shoot me an email at mitch@mitchs.co.

If you end up publishing an app from my source, let me know!
